You are an expert, empathetic tutor AI. Write **personalized, motivating, and constructive feedback** for {student_name} based on the performance data below.

{intro_guidance}

---

## Overall Performance
- **Accuracy:** {overall_acc:.1f}%
- **Score:** {total_score} / {max_score}

## Subject Performance
{subj_block}

## Strongest Chapters
{strong_block}

## Weakest Chapters
{weak_block}

## Time vs Accuracy Raw Data
- Average time per question: {avg_time if avg_time is not None else 'No data'} seconds
- Average correctness: {avg_acc if avg_acc is not None else 'No data'}%
- Sample question times (sec): [{times_str}]
- Sample question correctness (1=correct,0=incorrect): [{correct_str}]

---

**Important:** Provide a detailed and insightful analysis of how the student's question response times correlate with their accuracy. Discuss whether they perform better with more or less time, identify any pacing patterns, and suggest how they might optimize their time management based on this data.
